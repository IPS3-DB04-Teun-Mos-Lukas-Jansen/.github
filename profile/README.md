## About us
We are [Teun Mos](https://github.com/TeunMos) and [Lukas Jansen](https://github.com/LukasJansen100), both at the time of building this project, studying ICT at Fontys university of aplied sciences. We are currently in our third semester, studying software engineering, and working together on this project.

## Our Idea
Our project idea is to create a "Dashboard" for people, to make it easier to navigate through all your digital services. The point of the dashboard is to centralize a lot of services that people use, so they don't need to spend a lot of time going from one to the other.

We want to make the dashboard as customizable as possible. The user should be able to choose which services they would like to enable, and which not. Our dashboard will try to have as many integrations with popular apps, websites, and more.

The dashboard will collect some data from services (where it's allowed!) and use it to create an easy environment where you can find information about your activities/history.

Since the idea for this dashboard is very broad, we can always choose to implement and integrate new services into the dashboard.
